#summary Download and Install instructions

= Generic =
The recommended way works nearly on all distributions.

Requirements:
 * python >= 2.5
 * python-setuptools >= 2.5
Steps:
{{{
   sudo easy_install trash-cli
}}}

= Ubuntu and Debian =
Don't use apt-get, this would install a very old version of trash-cli that contain a serious bug that could destroy your data.

I asked Debian to update theirs package but without luck. 

Please, if you are interested, ask to Debian/Ubuntu to upgrade their version of trash-cli.

Use this instead:
{{{
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install trash-cli
}}}
