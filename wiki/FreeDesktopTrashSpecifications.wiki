#summary FreeDesktop.org Trash Specification

= Introduction =

The [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/trash-spec FreeDesktop.org Trash Specification] tell how different implementations should use the same data storage to represent the Trashcan.

trash-cli and KDE follows this specification so they can interoperate. 

I hope the GNOME project will soon adhere too.

The current version of the specification is the 0.7 and is avaialble at http://www.ramendik.ru/docs/trashspec.html


For this project, an unique identifier was added to each requirement.

The requirement identifier are reported in this [http://andreafrancia.it/trash/numbered-trashspec.html modified version] of the specification.
