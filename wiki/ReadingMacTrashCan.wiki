This page is about the support of reading mac trashcan. 

= How the mac trashcan works =

At this time we don't know if there is a pubblicy available specification of the data structure used by Finder for the trashcan.

These information are collected without observing a running Mac, only reading about it in the jpschewe comment in issue 36 and on the internet. Feel free to update these information.

In Mac there are these trashcan directories:
 - ~/.Trash
 - $topdr/.Trashes/$uid 

Where:
 * $topdir is the mounting point of a volume
 * $uid is the UID of a user

The behavior of trashing files is given by example:

Suppose I start with the trashcan empty.

What happen if I trash a file named 'foo.txt'?
 * The file is moved in ~./Trash/foo.txt

What happen if I trash another file named 'foo.txt'?
 * The file is moved in "~./Trash/foo $date $random.txt"
   Where: 
    * $date: is ???? which format?
    * $random: is ????

What happen if I trash a file with multiple extension, for example 'foo.tar.gz'?
 * The is moved to ????

What happen if I trash a file from a path not in the home?
 * ???

What happen if I trash a file from a path in a subdir of the home?
 * ???
