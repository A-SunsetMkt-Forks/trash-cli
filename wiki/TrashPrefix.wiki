#summary How the command interface changed to the trash-* form.

The earlier versions of trash-cli uses these commands names:
 * trash
 * empty-trash
 * list-trash
 * restore-trash

The the commands names where renamed from *-trash to trash-* that will exploit the shell TAB-completion. This change was suggested by Behdad Esfahbod (see https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-October/msg00231.html).
