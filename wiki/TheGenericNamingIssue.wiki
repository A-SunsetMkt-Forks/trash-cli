The trash-cli project provide a Command Line Interface to FreeDesktop.org Trash.
Ideally trash-cli provide these commands:
 
 * trash            # trashes files and directories.
 * trash-empty      # empty the trashcan(s).
 * trash-list       # list trashed files.
 * trash-restore    # restore a trashed file.

The people at RedHat thinks that the name of the 'trash' command is too generic,
and they don't want add it to fedora until 

The discussion started on:

Now, if I want my project will be added to Fedora, I need to change the 'trash' 
command name, but I can't find a name good as the original one.
