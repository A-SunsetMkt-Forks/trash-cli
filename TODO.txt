Features backlog:
 - trash-list should handle .trashinfo from home trashdir that contains 
   relative path
 - trash-list should print also the orphan files
 - support alias rmdir=trash-put
 - don't use world writable trash
 - enable trash-put home fallback
 - trash-empty removes files until a certain amount of space has been restored
 - trash-list --raw
 - trash-list <directory-name>
 - trash-list -R <directory-name>                 # recursive
 - trash-restore <path>                           # restore the newest
 - trash-restore <path> <dest>                    # restore to a certain destination
 - trash-restore --trashed-on="Apr 15, 08" <path>
 - trash-restore --version
 - trash-empty --from=/.Trash
 - trash-rm '*.o'
 - trash-empty should empty even the mac trash directory

To be fixed:
 - invalidate Google Code download and put a redirect to PyPi
 - get rid of logging package
 - get rid of the IOError exception raising on file is not in the same volume
 - consolidate TrashDirectory abstract and the AvailableTrashDir abstraction
 - get rid of TrashDirectory.info_dir and files_dir properties
 - remove all the duplication 
    - all_info_files, trashed_files and for_all_trashed_files
 - restore the stress test for persist trashinfo (not sure)
 - remove NullReporter if not used
 - get rid of TrashInfo abstraction
 - get rid of TimeUtils.parse_iso8601 if not used
 - rename remove_file in to remove_existing_file
 - refactor TrashPutCmd for simplicity

Test to be ported to nosetests:
 - trash-put:
    - trash in home trashcan
    - print version
    - trash in volume trashcan 1
    - trash in volume trashcan 2
 - it should trash to $topdir/.Trash-UID when $topdir/.Trash is not suitable
    - when $topdir/.Trash does not exists 
    - when $topdir/.Trash is a symlink
    - when $topdir/.Trash is not sticky
 - should refuse to create the $topdir/.Trash/$uid directory if the 
   $topdir/.Trash is not sticky
